- has mappings between events and handlers
- on mousemove look for collisions to get a pair of objects
- event is probably a pair of objects: dragged, other object
- is that pair a valid combination
- callbacks are
  - do/preview
  - undo


- hierarchical things
  - register event handlers on each node in a list
  - or have the list delegate events
