Plan of attack:
---------------
* Focus on creating three vocabularies for built-in objects, like numbers, strings, and lists:
  * A visual vocabulary for visualizing the object
  * A direct manipulation vocabulary for describing changes to the object
  * An animation vocabulary for playing back the changes, which will probably be a cleaned-up version the DM vocab.
* Make it possible to save, export and share drawn examples and traced algorithms.
* Evaluate

And later!
* Create a visual/DM/animation vocabulary for describing flow control and abstraction, so you can begin to generalize the algorithm
* Enable simulation of that algorithm on (1) the rest of the current example, (2) other drawn examples.
